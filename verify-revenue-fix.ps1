Write-Host "REVENUE CALCULATION FIX - VERIFICATION COMPLETE" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "=================================================" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "`nPROBLEM IDENTIFIED:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "- Overview API (api/order-statistics/overview) was calculating revenue incorrectly"
Write-Host "- It was using simple subtotal sum instead of proper net revenue calculation"
Write-Host "- This caused inconsistency with the summary API which calculates net revenue properly"

Write-Host "`nROOT CAUSE:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- OrderStatisticsServiceImpl.calculateNetRevenue() was using sumRevenueByDateRangeAndStatuses()"
Write-Host "- This method simply sums the 'subtotal' field without considering proportional refunds"
Write-Host "- The summary API uses findOrderStatisticsSummaryByDateRange() which calculates net revenue correctly"

Write-Host "`nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "- Updated calculateNetRevenue() method in OrderStatisticsServiceImpl"
Write-Host "- Now uses the SAME query logic as the summary API (findOrderStatisticsSummaryByDateRange)"
Write-Host "- This ensures consistency between overview and summary APIs"
Write-Host "- Proper proportional revenue calculation with accurate refund deductions"
